neuronID
========
This is the neuronID toolbox, used to identify cell bodies 
and major projections in a variety of datatypes.  Readers and converters 
to solve a variety of common system engineering challenges are also provided.

This is an initial version of the toolbox, under active development.  Currently the 
only functionality supported is the ability to read in data from an OCP project, annotate
truth data, and save the result as a series of PNG stacks.
