*This tool uses CAJAL to pull and push data appropriately.  It is not necessary for all annotators to use CAJAL, as long as they have a mechanism (such as a grad student) to help pull and push data.  Machine learners need only to be able to develop and deploy classifiers within the respective tool.*
