ndod provides an integrated environment to create ground truth, parse data with diverse, community-supported machine learning, image processing and computer vision tools, and deploy trained methods at scale.
ndod is now the parent site for:  mano [manual annotation for neuroscience operations], brain [big-data research algorithms to inform neuroscience], and dragon [deployment resources for annotation generation and open neuroscience].  All of our code is open source and available here: `Github repo <https://github.com/openconnectome/ndod>`_.

For documentation and usage instructions please see `our docs <http://docs.neurodata.io>`_ (under parse).
