Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
********************************

This page will be updated to reflect commonly asked questions to provide a common reference point for questions and answers.  Users may also wish to search for answers on the general `OCP Support mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ocp-support>`_ archives.

New questions should be asked on  `our support pages <ocp-support@googlegroups.com>`_.

**How do I get started?**

Please begin with the configuration page, which should get you up and running in no time.

**What are the limitations of your protocol?**

This initial version of ocp-ilastik provides a simple wrapper of ilastik functionality and instructions for running in the OCP ecosystem.   We have only tested 8-bit single channel data, although we use multipage TIFFs for interfacing between the two tools, so many datatypes will likely work.

**What updates are planned?**

We develop new functionality in response to user needs.  We are currently considering wrappers for ilastik object detection, manual annotation, and more complete documentation of OCP data loading in ilastik (an existing capability).  If these are useful additions for you, please let us know!
