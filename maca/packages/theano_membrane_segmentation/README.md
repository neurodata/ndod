Overview
-------

This package contains software for classifying electron microscopy (EM) data as either "membrane" or "non-membrane" at the pixel level.  The basic approach follows that of [Ciresan] and uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to solve the classification problem.

**Note that this package is included mainly for posterity since it has been supplanted by the Caffe-based version (see the "caffe_membrane_segmentation" package).
We recommend using the Caffe version for all future tasks.**
