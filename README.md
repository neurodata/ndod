**ndparse** is the NeuroData Parse parent repository

This repo contains the code needed to train, evaluate, and deploy code for parsing volumes of NeuroData images. 

It contains the legacy code for manno and macho.  The current version of ndod is divided into the three major components required to parse neuroscience data at scale:

- **mana**: manual annotation
- **maca**: big-data research algorithms to inform neuroscience
- **maxa**: deployment resources for annotation generation and open neuroscience
