**ndod** is the NeuroData Object Detection parent repository

This repo contains the code needed to train, evaluate, and deploy code for parsing volumes of NeuroData images. 

It contains the legacy code for manno and macho.  The current version of ndod is divided into the three major components required to parse neuroscience data at scale:

- **mano**: manual annotation
- **macho**: big-data research algorithms to inform neuroscience
- **maxa**: deployment resources for annotation generation and open neuroscience

We also include the NeuronID legacy code for completeness.

Note that this repo is no longer actively maintained.  We are currently building our parse functionality into a new python package [here](http://github.com/neurodata/ndparse)
