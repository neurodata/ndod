It contains the legacy code for manno and macho.  The current version of ndod is divided into the three major components required to parse neuroscience data at scale:

- **mano**:  manual annotation for neuroscience operations
- **brain**: big-data research algorithms to inform neuroscience
- **dragon**: deployment resources for annotation generation and open neuroscience
